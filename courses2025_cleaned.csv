"HAI5016","HUMAN-AI Interaction and Data Science","2025","Autumn","Seoul","DBI","MS","3","The purpose of this course is to understand data science techniques required to solve Human–AI Interaction problems and to acquire the ability to apply them to real-world situations. Throughout the course, students will develop a critical perspective on how to interpret Human–AI Interaction, gain insight into the decision-making processes of contemporary AI algorithms, and learn practical data science methodologies to address the emerging challenges in this domain. As the use of AI systems continues to expand, their influence on daily human experiences grows correspondingly. In particular, AI algorithms increasingly act as information gatekeepers, determining the content users encounter in digital environments. This gatekeeping function, once carried out by editorial professionals in traditional media such as newspapers and television, is now largely automated through AI-driven content curation systems. These systems recommend information judged to be most relevant to users by analyzing behavioral patterns, inferred preferences, and correlations among users and content. In this interactive loop, users consume AI-curated content while simultaneously providing behavioral data that informs and refines the AI’s future decisions. In return, the AI system offers increasingly personalized services. However, despite the widespread deployment of AI across content domains including film, music, journalism, and e-commerce, the ideal form of interaction between human users and AI systems remains under active exploration. One of the critical challenges in this space is the lack of transparency in AI decision-making. Users are often unaware of how recommendations are generated, and the design of interface elements in AI services can either enhance or obscure this understanding. This opacity undermines user trust, as individuals are unlikely to place confidence in systems whose reasoning and operations remain hidden. The resulting distrust in AI may diminish user engagement, hinder the adoption of beneficial technologies, and ultimately compromise the societal value of AI services. Accordingly, this course not only provides technical training in data science but also encourages reflection on the ethical, social, and psychological dimensions of Human–AI Interaction. By the end of the course, students will be equipped with both theoretical foundations and practical skills to contribute meaningfully to the development of responsible, trustworthy, and human-centered AI systems."
"DAI5013","Advanced Computer Vision","2025","Spring","Seoul","IFI","MS","3","Computer vision is one of the fastest developing fields of artificial intelligence in recent years, and its purpose is to acquire, process, analyze, and understand starting information such as photographs and videos recording the three-dimensional world. In this course, students learn basic concepts and methodologies related to undergraduate computer vision and their applications. Topics covered in this course include image processing and segmentation, feature point detection, optics, image tracking, camera model, 3D reconstruction, and recognition and detection of people and objects."
"DAI5015","Theories of Convergence Information","2025","Spring","Seoul","IFI","MS","3","To study deep into digital content, an accurate understanding of “Digital Information” which is the basic unit of digital content is necessary. This course is an introductory course on digital information. This course will introduce various characteristics of digital information, and investigate it in terms of pricing information, digital intellectual property, and so on."
"DIM5029","AI and Trust","2025","Autumn","Seoul","IFI","MS","3","AI and Trust This course examines various factors that AI services should consider to ensure trustworthiness, with the goal of developing and using socially responsible AI. It begins by exploring fundamental ethical, legal, and social issues to understand AI's influence on individuals and society. Subsequently, it introduces core principles and frameworks for designing and implementing trustworthy AI. The course also reviews key elements affecting data bias, algorithmic transparency, explainability, relationship and trust building. Students will critically analyze complex issues in AI development and use through real-world case studies and existing research to identify solutions from interdisciplinary approach. By the end, students will gain the knowledge and a deeper understanding of AI use needed to design socially responsible AI."
"HAI5012","Research Methods and Intro to Statistics","2025","Spring","Seoul","IFI","MS","3","This course offers an overview of research methodology including basic concepts employed in quantitative research methods. Students will have training to write a research paper using quantitative research methods. In the first half of the semester, we will cover various research methodologies, overall research processes, the structure of research paper, and the key elements of research including independent/ dependent variables, validity and reality. In the second half of the semester, we will learn statistical analysis including both descriptive and inferential statistics."
"HAI5019","Advanced Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis","2025","Autumn","Seoul","IFI","MS","3","This course will cover advanced text mining and sentiment analysis methodologies across various domains. The objective is to equip graduate students (MS/PhD) with a comprehensive understanding of sentiment analysis research areas and expertise in applying text mining techniques within their respective fields of study. It will help students in understanding the technical information related to text mining and sentiment analysis as presented in academic papers."
"WIS5018","Human Technology (Media) Interaction","2025","Autumn","Seoul","IFI","MS","3","Advanced survey of socio-psychological consequences of human interaction with media and computers. Key themes are 1) how minds have evolved to interact with media and computers in certain ways, 2) how media form and content influence the mind, 3) how minds socially respond to computers, 4) how media and computers create sense of “being there” and/or “being together with someone,” and 5) how properties (e.g., emotion, arousal, attention, memory, attitude) of human cognition and affection are affected by the form, content, and use of media and computers."
"WIS5078","User Experience and Artificial Intelligence","2025","Spring","Seoul","IFI","MS","3","This course address several research issues on user experience(UX) and artificial intelligence(AI), focusing on UX trends and lifestyles (Human), AI and computing technologies (Computer), and AI-based UX services (Interaction). The course is conducted through individual or group meeting. Students are required to prepare and complete a research paper through a few steps. The papers can be submitted to an international conference (e.g., CHI, UIST, DIS) or an international journal (e.g., International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, Computers in Human Behavior)."
